## accessibility-insights-for-android-service-bin

### Notice
The Accessibility Insights team is proud to provide accessibility scanning solutions across multiple platforms including Web, Windows Desktop, and Android. Unfortunately, the usage of Accessibility Insights for Android did not meet expectations and we will be **ending support of that product** effective June 1 2023, so we can focus on our more popular products for Web and Windows Desktop.Â The product download link will be removed to promote security and discourage use of an unmaintained version of the product. The source code will remain available under the MIT open-source license. We are grateful to the community who continue to use our accessibility testing products!

This NPM package is CommonJS module that acts as a thin wrapper around the [Accessibility Insights for Android Service](../README.md) APK file. The package bundles a copy of the APK and exports the path and version of the bundled APK (and its associated NOTICE file).

This wrapper package is intended for consumption by [Accessibility Insights for Android](https://github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-web); **we make no guarantees about its API stability or fitness for other purposes.**

Note that the `apkPath` and `noticePath` exports are defined relative to `__dirname`, which means that they may not be usable in a bundled environment. For Accessibility Insights for Android, we read them during our build process and copy the files to a location our packaging setup understands. 

### Versioning

This wrapper package's version matches the version of the bundled APK. It **does not use semantic versioning**; we reserve the right to make breaking API changes to the wrapper package without a major version update.

### Typescript usage

```ts
import { noticePath, apkPath, apkVersionName } from 'accessibility-insights-for-android-service-bin';

console.log(`Absolute path of the APK bundled with the package: ${apkPath}`);
console.log(`APK_VERSION_NAME of the bundled APK: ${apkVersionName}`);
console.log(`Absolute path of the NOTICE file for the APK: ${noticePath}`);
```
